Terms and Conditions (T&C)

Last Updated: 7 November, 2025

Welcome to Picy Trade. By using this app, you agree to comply with the following terms and conditions:

1. App Usage

Picy Trade allows users to view and purchase digital images in the app.

Purchases are consumable, meaning the same image can be sold to multiple users multiple times.

The app does not require a user account; purchases are identified by a unique token (Purchase ID).

2. Purchases

All purchases are processed through Google Play In-App Purchase (IAP).

Payment can be made using credit/debit cards, Play Points, or Google Play coupons where supported.

Upon purchase, users receive a unique token on the Done Screen.

Users must email this token to picyincorporation@gmail.com
 to receive the high-resolution image.

The app does not store purchased images locally in full resolution.

3. Refunds

All purchases are non-refundable once the transaction is completed through Google Play.

Refunds are only handled through Google Play policies, not directly by the app.

4. User Responsibility

Users are responsible for sending the correct token to receive the high-resolution image.

Users should not share tokens with others.

5. Intellectual Property

All images in the app are owned or licensed by the app developer.

Users may purchase digital copies for personal use only.

Redistribution, resale, or commercial use of the images is strictly prohibited.

6. Limitation of Liability

Picy Trade is provided “as-is” without any warranties.

The developer is not responsible for lost emails, invalid tokens, or delayed email responses.

7. Changes

Terms may be updated occasionally. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of updated terms.
